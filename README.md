setconf
=======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xyproto/setconf.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xyproto/setconf)

Setconf is a small utility for changing settings in configuration textfiles.

It has no dependencies except the built-in Python modules.

Pull requests are welcome.


Compile time features
---------------------

* It can be compiled to native with <a href="http://nuitka.net/">nuitka</a>. Try these parameters: `--exe --lto --python-version=2.7`


TODO
----

* A flag for changing the n'th occurence.
* A cleaner way to handle arguments, without adding an external dependency.
* A flag for commenting out keys (adding "# ")
* A flag for removing a value instead of using `''`.
* A flag for removing both the key and the value.
* Rewrite in a different language?
* Optimize the code that is used for adding options with `-a`.
* A way to add an option with `-a` after a given string occurs.
* Test and fix the combination of `-a` and multiline markers.
* Fix the behavior when `"` is the multiline marker and `:` the delimiter (the [yml](https://fdik.org/yml/) format).
* Document which assignment symbols and comment markers are supported.
* Refactor.
* Support both `#define` and `%define` (ref asmttpd).
